"""
Provides logic to authenticate a Playwright page session into LinkedIn Sales Navigator.

This module is intended to handle the entire login flow:
- Inserting credentials into login fields.
- Handling two-factor authentication (if required).
- Waiting for the authenticated session page to load fully.
- Optionally, loading session cookies to bypass login if available.

NOTE: Actual authentication logic depends on your credentials and requirements,
and should be implemented accordingly.
