"""
This module provides utilities to reduce the likelihood of detection by LinkedIn or
other platforms when automating web interactions. It includes rate limiting and
artificial delays to mimic human-like behavior. Future enhancements might include:
- Random mouse movements and clicks.
- Natural scroll patterns.
- Dynamic proxy rotation strategies.
- Varying user agents, viewport sizes, and timings.

While these techniques won't guarantee undetectability, they help reduce obvious
bot-like patterns.
